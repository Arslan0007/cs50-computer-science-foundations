# Week 0: Computational Thinking with Scratch

## Project: [Name of your Scratch Game/Animation]

### Overview
This project marks the beginning of my CS50 journey. The goal was not just to create an animation, but to implement core computer science concepts using a visual interface before transitioning to C.

### Key Concepts Implemented
* **Loops:** Used to handle continuous movement and background scrolling (similar to `while(true)` loops in system daemons).
* **Conditionals:** `If/Else` statements to handle collision detection and score updates.
* **Variables:** State management for the Score and Speed counters.
* **Events:** Asynchronous triggers (broadcast/receive) to coordinate interactions between sprites.

### The "Engineer's View"
Even in a visual language, the logic remains strict. Managing the "state" of the game in Scratch requires the same logical flow as managing state in a Python script or a Docker container lifecycle.
